Update to latest SDL_gfx library and fix color format compatibility

- Updated SDL_gfx library to latest version from https://github.com/ferzkopp/SDL_gfx
- Added missing SDL_gfxBlitFunc.c compilation to Makefile to resolve GFX_ALPHA_ADJUST_ARRAY undefined reference
- Fixed color format compatibility: new SDL_gfx expects RGBA format (0xRRGGBBAA) instead of surface-mapped colors
- Convert SDL_MapRGB colors to RGBA format in pixelColor() and lineColor() calls using SDL_GetRGB()
- Resolves trailing artifacts behind stars during ship movement caused by API changes

Files modified:
- Makefile: Added SDL_gfxBlitFunc.o to build dependencies
- graphic.cc: Updated pixelColor/lineColor calls to use RGBA color format
- SDL_gfxPrimitives.h/c: Updated to latest version
- SDL_gfxBlitFunc.h/c: Added from latest SDL_gfx
- SDL_rotozoom.h/c: Updated to latest version
